[CFRI &amp; CIRF Joint Conference 2023] Predicting Stock Returns based on Convolutional Neural  Networks with Feature Operators

Authors: Jingzhi Huang, Peilin Liu, Jun Ni, Jingyi Zhou 

We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model consisting of six feature operators, which are designed to extract valuable features from the stock trading data. We apply this method to the Chinese stock market and construct a model with significant out-of-sample predictive power for stock returns, termed as AlphaNet. To verify the modelâ€™s effectiveness, its forecast for the 5-day return is back-tested as a trading signal, using the portfolio sort method. Furthermore, it is controlled by the multi-factor risk model and previous China anomalies and compared with other common machine learning methods. The portfolio position optimization is also employed to evaluate and improve its performance on real market investment. These results indicate that AlphaNet shows promise as a skillful method to predict stock returns in the cross-section.
